      This is a paragraph element, which means that the first line will be indented by 3em (i.e., three times the computed
      <code>font-size</code> of the text in the paragraph). The other lines in the paragraph will not be indented, no matter how long the
      paragraph may be.

    <img src="./star.gif" alt="An image of a five-pointed star."/>
    <p id="Negative">
      This paragraph has a negatively indented first line, which overlaps the floated image that precedes the text. Subsequent lines do not
      overlap the image, since they are not indented in any way.
    </p>

      <p>
        This paragraph is contained inside a DIV, which is 400px wide, so the first line of the paragraph is indented 40px (400 * 10% = 40).
        This is because percentages are computed with respect to the width of the element.

        This first line of the DIV is indented by 50 pixels.
        <p>
          This paragraph is 200px wide, and the first line of the paragraph is indented 50px. This is because computed values for
          <code>text-indent</code>are inherited, instead of the declared values.
