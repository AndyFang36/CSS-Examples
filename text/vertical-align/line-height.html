        This paragraph's 'font-size' is 18px, but the inherited 'line-height'
        value is only 10px. This may cause the lines of text to overlap each
        other by a small amount.

    <div id="Two">
      <p>
        This paragraph's 'font-size' is 18px, and since the 'line-height'
        set for the parent div is 1.5, the 'line-height' for this paragraph
        is 27px (18 * 1.5).
