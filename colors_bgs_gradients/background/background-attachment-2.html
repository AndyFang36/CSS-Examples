    <h1>What is apple?</h1>
    <p>
      An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide
      and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild
      ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and
      Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological
      significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apple trees are large if grown from seed. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by grafting onto rootstocks,
      which control the size of the resulting tree. There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in
      a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and use, including cooking,
      eating raw and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems,
      which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced
      as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of the
      total.
