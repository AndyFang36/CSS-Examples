      <h1>Grape's History</h1>
      <p>
        The cultivation of the domesticated grape began 6,000–8,000 years ago in the Near East. Yeast, one of the
        earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the discovery of
        alcoholic drinks such as wine. The earliest archeological evidence for a dominant position of wine-making in
        human culture dates from 8,000 years ago in Georgia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The oldest known winery was found in Armenia, dating to around 4000 BC. By the 9th century AD the city of
        Shiraz was known to produce some of the finest wines in the Middle East. Thus it has been proposed that Syrah
        red wine is named after Shiraz, a city in Persia where the grape was used to make Shirazi wine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics record the cultivation of purple grapes, and history attests to the ancient
        Greeks, Phoenicians, and Romans growing purple grapes both for eating and wine production. The growing of
        grapes would later spread to other regions in Europe, as well as North Africa, and eventually in North America.
      </p>
      <p>
        In North America, native grapes belonging to various species of the genus Vitis proliferate in the wild across
        the continent, and were a part of the diet of many Native Americans, but were considered by early European
        colonists to be unsuitable for wine. In the 19th century, Ephraim Bull of Concord, Massachusetts, cultivated
        seeds from wild Vitis labrusca vines to create the Concord grape which would become an important agricultural
        crop in the United States.

      <h1>What Is Cat?</h1>
      <p>
        The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated
        species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild
        members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely
        and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt
        rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]
      </p>

      <p>
        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp
        teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well
        developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and
        grunting as well as cat-specific body language. It is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds
        too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. It is a
        predator that is most active at dawn and dusk.[7] It secretes and perceives pheromones.[8]
      </p>

      <p>
        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to
        five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat
        fancy. Failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets,
        resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and
        reptile species, and evoking population control.[10]
      </p>

      <p>
        Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BCE.[11] It was long thought that cat domestication
        was initiated in ancient Egypt, as since around 3100 BCE veneration was given to cats in ancient Egypt.[12][13]
        As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats
        owned.[14][15][16] In the United Kingdom, around 7.3 million cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as
        of 2019.[17]
