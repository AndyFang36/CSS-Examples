        This paragraph has a border and some padding. The padding keeps the border away from the
        text content, which is generally more visually appealing. The converse is usually true for
        replaced content like images.

      <p>This paragraph has a border and no padding. The lack of padding means the border is very
        close to the text content, which is generally not visually appealing. The converse is
        usually
        true for replaced content like images.

          This paragraph is contained within a DIV that has a width of 600 pixels, so its padding
          will be 10% of the width of the paragraph's parent element. Given the declared width of
          600 pixels, the padding will be 60 pixels on all sides.

          This paragraph is contained within a DIV with a width of 300 pixels, so its padding will
          still be 10% of the width of the paragraph's parent. There will, therefore, be half as
          much padding on this paragraph as that on the first paragraph.

        This is a paragraph that contains some <strong>strongly emphasized text</strong> which has
        been styled with padding and a background. This <strong>does not affect the line
        heights</strong>, as explained in the text, but there are other effects that need to be
        taken into account.

        has been styled with padding and a background. <img src="girl.JPEG" alt="girl">This does
